# Bellevue - MS in Data Science

### This is a collection of my past projects that I have worked on & current projects that I am working on as part of the masters program.

### Most of the projects are done in Python as I have a personal bias for the language. As a systems engineer by profession, I am proficient with Python. I don't see the need to learn another language when there are enough Python packages available for almost any analytics task that you can think of.
