### Problem Statement
Video Gaming has evolved from the days of PAC-MAN and arcades. The world of computer games is now a powerful and profitable business (Teradata, 2017). Games have started to become more and more complex in terms of design. Player economy ecosystems need to be maintained, and we no longer create games from a fire-and-forget point of view (Solarwinds Loggly, 2016). Big Data has already made its way into every single aspect of the gaming industry. Whether it's collecting data from the users, targeted marketing, better user experience, or even customer focus, Big Data has got you covered. Analytics is not about trend analysis anymore, it is driving the product development for gaming companies. In this paper we will focus on the common use cases of data analytics in the gaming industry..

### Conclusion
Data science helps developers create better AI for the games being produced. Smarter and more intuitive AI creates a better experience for the user because of the increased unpredictability in the game. Data science is very important to game monetization because this is ultimately where the company's profit lies. It is important to know who your top players are and collect data on their preferences to improve your game. Data science in games is only going to become better over the years creating more profits and better user experiences.
