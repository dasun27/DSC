You can find the full report here [US Airline Safety](https://github.com/dasun27/DSC/blob/master/files/US%20AIrline%20Safety.pptx)

### Dataset
The dataset used in my analysis is from Dear Mona, Which State Has The Worst Drivers? article, and was obtained through 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/fivethirtyeight-bad-drivers-dataset).

The dataset includes these variables:

Variable | Source
---|---------
State | N/A
Number of drivers involved in fatal collisions per billion miles | National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2012
Percentage Of Drivers Involved In Fatal Collisions Who Were Speeding | National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2009
Car Insurance Premiums ($) | National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 2011
Losses incurred by insurance companies for collisions per insured driver ($) | National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 2010

### Problem Statement and Hypothesis
I wanted to find out if percentages of driver involved in fatal collisions who were alcohol-impaired may have influence on the percentages of driver involved in fatal collisions who were speeding.
