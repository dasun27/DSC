### Hypothesis
Price of a game has a significant impact on its success - Using statistical methods and regression analysis, I will be testing this hypothesis. Further, I will also explore the impact of some factors such as the developer of a game and the genre of a game on the success of a game. In this analysis, success of a game is solely measured based on its average user rating.

### Conclusion
Price of a game doesnâ€™t seem to have a significant effect on the ratings of a game. Only a weak correlation could be seen between the two variables. However, when both the developer of a game, and the price were considered together, it had a much greater impact on the success of a game. The model that comprised of both the developer and price, could explain 78% of the variability in this data set. Yet, there are many other factors such as the original release date and the genre that has not been analyzed in this study, which could also have a potential impact on the success of a game.
