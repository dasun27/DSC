### Problem Statement
In this project, my task was to build a dashboard highlighting the most important facts about safety in the US airline industry.

### Conclusion
This dashboard is a summary of Aircraft accidents, fatalities associated, and also motor vehicle accidents over the last 2 decades. It also includes a summary of the net income of major airlines in 2019. My goal is to emphasize the fact that as a transport method, airlines is still a good choice for passengers. If we focus on the single most important aspect of any transport method which is safety, you can see in the second graph that fatal accidents are almost negligible compared to non-fatal accidents, in the aviation industry. Also, if we compare those numbers with the fatalities involved with motor vehicles, one can see the numbers are much lower with aircraft carriers.
