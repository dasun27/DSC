### Problem Statement
Some of the states in US are well known for their high living costs while some others are considered to be more affordable than the rest. Yet, some people still manage to live in those expensive states while some others might be struggling even in inexpensive states. For example, A common belief is that if you are moving to California from a different state, you need to make at least 20 - 30% more than what earned in a different state. I am trying to find some data driven evidence for these stereotypes and figure out if they still hold true when considering the average income raise, and also, if they hold true for most parts of a given state.

### Conclusion
Depending on your age you can figure out Minnesota is the right state for you. It seems much better for younger people. housing costs and other costs seem pretty standard across the states. A few counties have high housing expenses though. Child care expenses and Taxes seem to vary a lot across the state. These 2 factors seem to be the most important when choosing an area to live in Minnesota.
