## Project Portfolio

### Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis

This is a project to analyze customer sentiment on US airlines based on tweets. My goal is to build a model to accurately predict the sentiment of the user based on raw text of the tweet. This involves text analysis using classification algorithm as well as some deep learning methods.

### Book Rating Analysis

As more and more users have become online readers and it is important to find books that are appealing to you. Here I am trying to build a book recommendation system based on a dataset from bookcrossings.com. I use both content based and collaborative filtering techniques here.

### Telco Customer Churning

Customer churning is a major problem to many leading industries and Telecom is no exception. Due to the finite number of customers in a given area, it is important that Telecom companies retain their customers as it is really hard to win back those who churn away. This is a model to predict the customers that are likely to churn based on some features available.

### Housing Affordability

Housing affordability is one of the biggest problems an average American has to solve during his lifetime. This is an attempt to find affordable housing areas based on a dataset taken from Housing Affordability Data System (HADS).

### US Airline Safety

This is a summarized slide deck on the safety of US airlines over the last 2 decades. It includes a comparison of motor vehicle accidents as well. My goal here was to emphasize the fact that as a transport method, airlines is still a good choice for passengers.

### Web Scraping

This is a Python script using LXML & Requests packages to extract data from an IMDB movie page.

### Chess Games Analysis

Here I am analyzing a dataset of 20k chess games collected from the website lichess.org. Using features such as player rating, colors, and time controls, I am trying to predict which openings are better for players at different levels.

### Cost of living in US

Some of the states in US are well known for their high living costs while some others are considered to be more affordable than the rest. Yet, some people still manage to live in those expensive states while some others might be struggling even in inexpensive states. Here I am trying to find some data driven evidence to pick a suitable place to live based on your personal income, family status and other available features.

### AppStore Games Analysis

Price of a game has a significant impact on its success. Using statistical methods and regression analysis, I am going to test this hypothesis. I am also going to study other factors that affect the success of a game.

### Growth of Online Gaming

Video Gaming has evolved from the days of PAC-MAN and arcades. The world of computer games is now a powerful and profitable business. This is a study about how modern gaming studios use analytics to enhance the user experience and drive more users into their platform.
