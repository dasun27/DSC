Welcome to my collection of data science projects. I am a technical account manager by profession and I work for one of the largest cloud service providers. I am a Sri lankan by birth and I moved to US 4 years ago, and I have been living in Denver Colorado ever since. I have a four months old beautiful daughter. My academic and professional background is in network engineering where I have worked as a network engineer for telcos and enterprises with large data center presence. These data science projects are done as part of the requirements for masters in data science program at Bellevue university. I have enjoyed learning a lot of new things through this program and I hope to get involved in a real world analytics project in the future.
